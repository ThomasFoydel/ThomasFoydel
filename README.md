# Hi I'm Thomas
Welcome to my GitHub. I work as a substitute TA at the Northwestern University coding bootcamp and as a grader, learning assistant, and tutor for 2U/Trilogy. I build web apps primarily in MERN stack. I particularly enjoy web sockets, animations, and the web audio api. Let's build something together.

### Current Projects
Right now I'm working on some MERN projects involving audio (drum machines and synthesizers). 
I'm currently studying firebase.
