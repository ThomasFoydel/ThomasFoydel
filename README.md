# Hi I'm Thomas
   Welcome to my GitHub. I work as a substitute TA at the Northwestern University coding bootcamp 
   and as a grader, learning assistant, and tutor for 2U/Trilogy. 
   I build web apps primarily in MERN stack. I've particularly enjoyed web sockets, 
   animations, and the Web Audio API. Let's build something together.

## Current Projects
    Right now I'm working on some MERN projects involving audio (drum machines and synthesizers). 
    I'm also studying firebase, typescript, and graphQL.

## Coolest Repos

### Clean Break
A [drum machine](http://cleanbreak.herokuapp.com/) built in MERN stack with Tone.js and animations done with react-spring [repo here](https://github.com/ThomasFoydel/drummachine).

### FM-Synth
A [frequency modulation synthesizer](http://fm-synth.herokuapp.com/) built in MERN stack with Tone.js and react-spring animations [repo here](https://github.com/ThomasFoydel/fmsynth).

### Pandatron
A [synthesizer](http://pandatron.herokuapp.com/) built built in MERN stack with the Web Audio API, Pizzicato effects, and react-spring animations [repo here](https://github.com/ThomasFoydel/oscillator-rx).

### Socket Chat
A [live chat room app](http://socketchat.xyz/) built in MERN stack with socket.io and react-spring animations [repo here](https://github.com/ThomasFoydel/chat).
